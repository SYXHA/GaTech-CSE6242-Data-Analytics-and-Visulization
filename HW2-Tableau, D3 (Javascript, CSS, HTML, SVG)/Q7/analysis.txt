Comparison of Python and D3.js

1. Ease to develop for developers [40 words]
Python's syntax is more convenient than JavaScript, so it is easier to code in
python. D3 requires a lot of familiarities with JavaScript.

2. Ease to maintain the visualization for developers (e.g., difficulty of the maintenance of the product as the requirements change, the data changes, the hosting platform changes, etc.) [40 words]
D3 is better at interacting with data due to the power of javascript, and is also well suited to graphic animations. Python is only good for numpy data.

3. Usability of visualization developed for end users [40 words]
D3 can be widely used in websites, while Python has more restrictions or requires
third-party packages to interact with websites.

4. Scalability of visualization to “large” datasets [40 words]
Python scales well with Hadoop, Spark, high-performance computing. D3 also scales well with Hadoop, Spark.

5. System requirements to run the visualization (e.g., browsers, OS, software licensing) for end users [40 words]
Python requires more third-party libraries to interact with browsers, making plots; 
D3 is more flexible with browsers and web visualization.
